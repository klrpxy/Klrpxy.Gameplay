# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root. It points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context; read the context relevant to the work.
- **`docs/adr/`** - read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.
- **`src/<context>/docs/adr/`** - if present, read context-scoped ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a multi-context repo:

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT-MAP.md
|-- docs/adr/
`-- src/
    `-- Klrpxy.Gameplay.Stats/
        `-- CONTEXT.md
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal - either you're inventing language the project doesn't use or there's a real gap to discuss.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
